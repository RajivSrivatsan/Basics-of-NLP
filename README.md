# Introduction to Natural Language Procesing

Natural Language is a way with which humans communicate with each other

e.g. text, speech

We are surrounded by texts.

e.g. SMS, Mails, Web pages

- Natural Language Processing is a field AI that deals with interaction between computers and humans using the natural Language
- NLP gives the machine the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages
- Most of NLP relies on ML to derive meaning from human languages.

Note: Machine Learning is a pre-requisite for NLP

Applications:

Few applications include: 

1. Machine translation => Google translate
2. Speech Recognition => Alexa, Siri, Google now, Cortana
3. Sentiment Analysis => Positive or negative in reviews provided by customers
4. Question Answering => Chatbot, Virtual Assistance
5. Automatic Summarization => Creating short accurate text from a huge document
6. Chatbot => Customer service for FAQ
7. Text Classifcation => Spam or Ham
8. CHaracter recognition 
9. Spell Checking => Grammarly, Quillbot

We will use Google Colab for better execution

Basics of NLP:

1) Tokenization
s1 = "I like apple."

Here I is a token, like is a token etc....

s2 = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for 1 billion$!
      import spacy
      nlp = spacy.load(name = 'en_core_web_sm') -- 

2) Stemming and Lemmatization
3) Stop Words
4) Vocabulary and Matching
5) Parts of Speech Tagging
6) Named Entity Recognition
7) Sentence Segmentation
